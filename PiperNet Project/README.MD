# The reproduction of the first version of PiedPiper.com  
This is another project from my ***HTML/CSS*** online-courses that I posted on GitHub.

I've made almost everything, apart of smooth movement after clicking on links in the header. 

### This project is more complicated than Wikipedia topic because here I was focused on CSS and tried to make a page that looks nice in different screen proportions.
